//AABB to AABB

if X collide, calculate smallest intersection
repeat for y and z

find the smallest of the existing intersections. Bump them out by that amount


//Box to Sphere



//Box to Plane


//cleaing up AABB to AABB

put into single intersection vector;
calculations done inside functions
give box a min and max extents value;

float xDelta = box2.min.x - box1.min.x;

if( xDelta > 0 ) {
	
}
